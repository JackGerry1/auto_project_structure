# Auto Project Structure Generator

Small utility to generate a tree representation of a project directory for inclusion in README/project docs. Provides both a GUI and a CLI.

## Features
- Walks a directory and builds a nested dictionary representation of files and folders using [`model.Model`](model/model.py) ([model/model.py](model/model.py)).
- Trims large folders to a configurable max number of entries.
- Pretty-prints tree output and can save as a markdown/text block.
- GUI built with [`view.View`](view/view.py) and [`controller.Controller`](controller/controller.py).
- CLI script for quick command-line export ([cli.py](cli.py)).
- Example project trees included in [examples/](examples/).

## Examples
See the [examples/](examples/) folder for sample project trees and sample outputs:
- [examples/test1/project_structure.txt](examples/test1/project_structure.txt)
- [examples/test2/project_structure.txt](examples/test2/project_structure.txt)

## Quick start

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+

Install: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JackGerry1/auto_project_structure.git
```

Run GUI:
```sh
python main.py
```
This launches the GUI which uses [`main.App`](main.py) ([main.py](main.py)), the [`model.Model`](model/model.py) model, the [`view.View`](view/view.py) view, and the [`controller.Controller`](controller/controller.py) controller.

Run CLI:
```sh
python cli.py /path/to/project 10
```
This saves a `project_structure.txt` file inside the provided path (trim length `10` in this example). See [cli.py](cli.py).

## Files of interest
- [`model.Model`](model/model.py) — core logic to build/trim/format structures ([model/model.py](model/model.py))
- [`controller.Controller`](controller/controller.py) — GUI control logic ([controller/controller.py](controller/controller.py))
- [`view.View`](view/view.py) — simple tkinter UI ([view/view.py](view/view.py))
- [`main.App`](main.py) — app entrypoint for GUI ([main.py](main.py))
- [cli.py](cli.py) — command-line usage
- [tests/test_model.py](tests/test_model.py) — unit tests illustrating usage of the model

## Results 
The above [Project Structure (Generated By The Script)](#project-structure-generated-by-the-script) generated by the script took a few seconds to generate and then about 30 seconds to verify it was correct and make any desired changes, wheras manually creating it would have taken a good few boring minutes, where I would have procastinated and done something else meaning it would take even longer.  


## Testing
Run tests with:
```sh
pytest
```
Tests cover building, trimming, and printing trees (see [tests/test_model.py](tests/test_model.py)).
