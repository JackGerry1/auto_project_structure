Idea given a project directory make a project structure for a Github README.md 

like the following: 
```
public/                   
src/
├── assets/
│   └── thankYouImage.png         
├── components/        
│   ├── CustomThankYouPDF.jsx        
│   ├── FormInput.jsx    
│   ├── GeneratePDFButton.jsx
│   └── Header.jsx
├── pages/             
│   └── ThankYouPage.jsx                     
├── services/          
│   └── pdfService.jsx                            
├── utils/
│   └── thankYouMessage.js                       
├── styles/
│   ├── CustomThankYouPDF.css        
│   ├── FormInput.css    
│   ├── GeneratePDFButton.css
│   └── Header.css                        
├── App.jsx            
├── main.jsx           
├── index.html            
.gitignore
package.json
vite.config.js
README.md
```

TODO List: 
get a desired path easy at the start 
then get each folder perhaps stored as a dictionary? like dict: [file1, file2 etc] or maybe if there is a folder store it [folder1/, folder2/] and then jump create a new key. 
maybe create a tree for the file structure. 
Print it out to verify if it is correct 
then print it out in the desired format. 
probably output this to a .md/.txt file for the user to copy and paste
maybe make a GUI so user can either type their directory or navigate to it

EDGE CASES: 
for some folders like data folders there will be lots of files, which should not be included, perhaps could just be a so take the first 9 and then last file. 
some folders will just contain other folders, eg in bigger react projects there could be components/forms/files. 
user enters the wrong path
